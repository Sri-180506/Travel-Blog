      <h1>Victoria Memorial: History</h1>

The Victoria Memorial, one of the top historical places in Kolkata, is the brainchild of Lord Curzon, a Viceroy of India. When Queen Victoria, who was the Empress of British India, died in January 1901, Curzon suggested building a grand memorial to honor her. He proposed the memorial to be a stately edifice with a museum where visitors get a glimpse of the marvels of the past. The foundation for the memorial was laid on 4 January 1906 by the Prince of Wales, who later became King George V. The building was formally inaugurated and opened for public visits in 1921.  Later, additions were made to the memorial after India gained independence.
<h1>Victoria Memorial Architecture</h1>

Located on Queen’s Way, Maidan, Victoria Memorial features Indo-Saracenic revivalist architectural style which displays a blend of Mughal and British elements along with Egyptian, Islamic, Venetian, and Deccani elements. Made of white Markana marble, the edifice has dimensions of 103 meters by 69 meters and reaches up to a height of 56 meters.
<br>
In terms of design, Victoria Memorial draws inspiration from the Taj Mahal. It has a main central dome, four smaller domes, high portals, domed chaatris of octagonal shape, domed towers at the corners, and terrace. The Angel of Victory, a 16-feet tall figure, stands on top of the central dome. You can find several allegorical sculptures surrounding the central dome, including Charity, Justice, Art, and Architecture. The North Porch has allegorical sculptures of Prudence, Motherhood, and Learning.
<h1>Victoria Memorial Light and Sound Show</h1>

In the evenings, the memorial becomes the site of one of the most captivating light and sound shows in India. The Victoria Memorial light and sound takes viewers on a fascinating journey through Kolkata’s heritage and history. Aptly titled Pride and Glory- the Story of Calcutta, it brings alive the innumerable erstwhile glories of the city on the screen.
